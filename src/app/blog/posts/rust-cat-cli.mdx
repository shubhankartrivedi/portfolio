summary: "We gonna code a rust program that mimics the cat command in terminal! This will help you understand how to work with files in Rust."
---

In this post, we will be creating a Rust program that mimics the `cat` command in Unix-like systems. The `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the content of files. Our program will read the content of a file and display it in the terminal.

# Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

# Setting up the project

Create a new Rust project using the following command:
```bash
$ cargo new cat
$ cd cat
```

# Writing the code

Delete the contents of the `src/main.rs` file and let's start writing the code.

This code imports the required crates:
```rust
use std::fs;
```
We will use the `std::fs` module to read the content of the file. This is the only module we need for this program.

Now let's code the main function.
```rust
// inside main function
 let file_path =  match std::env::args().nth(1) {
        Some(file_path) => file_path,
        None => {
            eprintln!("Please provide a file path");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
```
The above code reads the first argument passed to the program and stores it in the `file_path` variable. If no argument is provided, it will print an error message and exit the program.

```rust
let content = match fs::read_to_string(file_path) {
        Ok(content) => content,
        Err(err) => {
            eprintln!("Error reading file: {}", err);
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
```
The above code reads the content of the file using the `fs::read_to_string` function. If the file is read successfully, it stores the content in the `content` variable. If there is an error, it prints an error message and exits the program.

```rust
println!("{}", content);
```
Finally, we print the content of the file to the terminal.

# Building and running the program

To build and run the program, use the following command:
```bash
$ cargo run <file_path>
```
Replace `<file_path>` with the path to the file you want to read.

# Conclusion

That's it! You have successfully created a Rust program that mimics the `cat` command. You can now read the content of files using your Rust program. Feel free to explore more features of Rust and enhance this program further.

## Full code
```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let file_path =  match std::env::args().nth(1) {
        Some(file_path) => file_path,
        None => {
            eprintln!("Please provide a file path");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
    let content = match fs::read_to_string(file_path) {
        Ok(content) => content,
        Err(err) => {
            eprintln!("Error reading file: {}", err);
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    };
    println!("{}", content);
}
```

I hope you enjoyed this post and learned something new.
