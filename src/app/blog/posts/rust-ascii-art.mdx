In this post, we will be creating a Rust program that converts an image to ASCII art and prints that in terminal {"("}*in colour aswell*{")"}.

# Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).



# Setting up the project

Create a new Rust project using the following command:
```bash
$ cargo new ascii_art
$ cd ascii_art
```

We will use the `image` crate to read the image and `colored` crate to print the ASCII art in colour. Add these dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
image = "0.25.1"
colored = "2.1.0"
```

Now, let's write the code to convert the image to ASCII art.

# Writing the code

Delete the contents of the `src/main.rs` file and add the following code.
This code imports the required crates:
```rust
// src/main.rs
use image::GenericImageView;
use colored::Colorize;
```

Now, let's write the function to convert the image to ASCII art.
We will use the `image::open` function to open the image and `image::GenericImageView` trait to get the dimensions of the image.
Don't forget to add your image file in the project directory where `Cargo.toml` is located.

### get_image function

```rust
// src/main.rs

fn get_image(dir: &str) {
    let img = image::open(dir).expect("File not found");
    println!("{:?}", img.dimensions());
}
fn main() {
    get_image("image.jpg");
}
```
```terminal
(1000,1000)
```

As you can see, the `get_image` function prints the dimensions of the image. Now, let's convert the image to ASCII art.
This will be a bit complex, so I will explain the code in parts next.
```rust
// src/main.rs
// in  get_image function

let (width, height) = img.dimensions();
    for y in 0..height {
        for x in 0..width {
            if y % (scale * 2) == 0 && x % scale == 0 {
                let pix = img.get_pixel(x, y);

                let mut intent = ((pix[0] as u32 + pix[1] as u32 + pix[2] as u32) / 3) as u8;

                if pix[3] == 0 {
                    intent = 0;
                }
                print!("{}", get_str_ascii(intent, negative).truecolor(pix[0], pix[1], pix[2]));
            }
        }
        if y % (scale * 2) == 0 {
            println!("");
        }
    }
```

Lets start from the top.

The code below gets the dimensions of the image and stores them in the `width` and `height` variables.
```rust
let (width, height) = img.dimensions();
```

The code below loops through the height of the image then the width of the image.
You can see we have `y` as the height and `x` as the width because MATHS ðŸ˜‚.
```rust
for y in 0..height {
 for x in 0..width {

 }
}
```

The code below checks if the current `y` is divisible by `scale * 2` and `x` is divisible by `scale`.
We do this to reduce the number of pixels we print to the terminal else the image will be too large for high-resolution image.



**Note:** This is because the height of a character is more than the width of a character in terminal. So by multiplying the scale by 2, we get a more accurate representation of the image.
```rust
if y % (scale * 2) == 0 && x % scale == 0 {

}
```

The code below gets the pixel at the current `x` and `y` position.
The `get_pixel` function returns a `Rgba<u8>` struct which contains the pixel data.
```rust
let pix = img.get_pixel(x, y);
```

The code below calculates the intensity of the pixel by averaging the red, green, and blue values.
We divide by 3 because we are converting the pixel to grayscale.

Also, we cast the result to `u8` because the `truecolor` function only accepts `u8` values.

**Note:** u8 is an unsigned 8-bit integer which ranges from 0 to 255.
```rust
let mut intent = ((pix[0] as u32 + pix[1] as u32 + pix[2] as u32) / 3) as u8;
```

**Optional:** You can use the formula below to get a more detailed intensity value.
```rust
let mut intent = (0.299 * pix[0] as f32 + 0.587 * pix[1] as f32 + 0.114 * pix[2] as f32) as u8;
```

The code below checks if the alpha value of the pixel is 0.
If the alpha value is 0, it means the pixel is transparent, so we set the intensity to 0.
```rust
if pix[3] == 0 {
 intent = 0;
}
```

The code below prints the ASCII character based on the intensity of the pixel.
We use the `get_str_ascii` function to get the ASCII character based on the intensity.
We also use the `truecolor` function to print the ASCII character in colour.
```rust
print!("{}", get_str_ascii(intent, negative).truecolor(pix[0], pix[1], pix[2]));
```

Now let's code the `get_str_ascii` function.

### get_str_ascii function

```rust
// src/main.rs

fn get_str_ascii(intent: u8, neg: bool) -> &'static str {
    let index = intent / 32;
    let mut ascii = [" ", ".", ",", "-", "~", "+", "=", "@"];
    if neg == true {
        ascii.reverse();
    }

    return ascii[index as usize];
}
```

Let's break down the code.

The code below calculates the index of the ASCII character based on the intensity of the pixel.
We divide the intensity by 32 because we have 8 ASCII characters and 256 intensity levels `(0 -> 255)`.
```rust
let index = intent / 32;
```

The code below creates an array of ASCII characters.
We use the `index` to get the ASCII character from the array.

**Note:** The ASCII characters are arranged from light to dark.
```rust
let mut ascii = [" ", ".", ",", "-", "~", "+", "=", "@"];
```

The code below checks if the `neg` parameter is `true`.
If it is `true`, it reverses the array to give the negative effect.
```rust
if neg == true {
 ascii.reverse();
}
```

The code below returns the ASCII character based on the `index`.

**Note:** We cast the `index` to `usize` because the array index must be an unsigned integer. `usize` is an unsigned integer that is the same size as a pointer.
```rust
return ascii[index as usize];
```

Now, the code is complete. You can run the program by calling the `get_image` function in the `main` function.

When calling the `get_image` function, pass the path to the image file as an argument.

**Note:** We use `&` before the file path to pass a reference to the string.
```rust
fn main() {
    let file = "image.jpg";
    let scale = 7;
    get_image(&file, scale, false);
}
```

**Note:** If your image is too large, you can increase the `scale` value to reduce the number of pixels printed to the terminal.

## Running the program

To run the program, use the following command:
```bash
$ cargo run
```

You should see the ASCII art of the image printed in the terminal.

## What's next?


You can add more features to the program and make it more interactive.
Like adding a command-line argument to pass the image file path like in the code below.

```rust
fn main() {
    let file = std::env::args().nth(1).expect("No file mentioned");
    let scale: u32 = std::env::args().nth(2).expect("Scale not mentioned").parse().unwrap();

    get_image(&file, scale, false);
}
```
```bash
$ cargo run image.jpg 7
```


# Conclusion

In this post, we created a Rust program that converts an image to ASCII art.
We used the `image` crate to read the image and `colored` crate to print the ASCII art in colour.

This is the full code of the program:
```rust
use colored::Colorize;
use image::GenericImageView;

fn get_str_ascii(intent: u8, neg: bool) -> &'static str {
    let index = intent / 32;
    let mut ascii = [" ", ".", ",", "-", "~", "+", "=", "@"];
    if neg == true {
        ascii.reverse();
    }

    return ascii[index as usize];
}

fn get_image(dir: &str, scale: u32, negative: bool) {
    let img = image::open(dir).expect("File not found");
    println!("{:?}", img.dimensions());
    let (width, height) = img.dimensions();
    for y in 0..height {
        for x in 0..width {
            if y % (scale * 2) == 0 && x % scale == 0 {
                let pix = img.get_pixel(x, y);
                let mut intent = ((pix[0] as u32 + pix[1] as u32 + pix[2] as u32) / 3) as u8;
                if pix[3] == 0 {
                    intent = 0;
                }
                print!(
                    "{}",
                    get_str_ascii(intent, negative).truecolor(pix[0], pix[1], pix[2])
                );
            }
        }
        if y % (scale * 2) == 0 {
            println!("");
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
    let file = std::env::args().nth(1).expect("No file mentioned");
    let scale: u32 = std::env::args().nth(2).expect("Scale not mentioned").parse().unwrap();
    get_image(&file, scale, false);
}
```
